# Quick News with BERT

## Introduction

Quick News with BERT is a proof of concept for the research project "Automated News Summarization with BERT-Powered Encoders" - part of the Natural Language Processing research at Hertie School in Berlin. Summaries models can be divided into three strands: <b>extractive</b> (summary taken directly from text) , <b>abstractive</b> (summary generated by encoders) or a mixture of both. 

This concept explores how these automated summary models can be utilized in real life setting. The user will be able to choose news sites that are of their interest and see the latest updated articles and generate their summaries quickly and efficiently.
