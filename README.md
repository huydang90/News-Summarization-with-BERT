# Automated News Summarization with BERT-Powered Encoders

## Introduction 

Text  summarization  is  one  of  the  central  challenges  in the  fields  of  Machine  Learning  and  Natural  Language Processing  (NLP).  Bidirectional  Encoder  Representations from Transformers (BERT), a new contextual pre-training method  for  language  representations,  has  been  heralded as the state-of-the-art neural network architecture that can outperform any others in over 11 complex NLP tasks at the time of its creation.  In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing BERT as the basis for a document level encoder that can capture and generate a representation for text sentences  and  meanings,  ultimately  providing  a  reliable  and accurate automated summarization process of news articles from different international outlets, based on the 

## Web Application 

With the app, the users will be able to copy news articles or any piece of writings and generate summaries based on three different models: <b>extractive</b> (summary taken directly from text) , <b>abstractive</b> (summary generated by encoders) or a mixture of both.

To launch the app, please download to clone the project into your local machine, change directory into the <b>src</b> folder of the <b>Web Application</b> folder, and download the following three files into the <b>models</b> folder. You will also need to install the Flask framework.

[BERT Mixed Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cfBNgrfvrUFxH6KYEX2XWLmOYqc5ZiRn/view?usp=sharing)  

```
$ pip install flask     # install Flask
$ cd src                # change directory to src folder
$ python app.py         # launch the app
```

The app will be launch on one of your local ports. Please copy and paste the url to your browser and test out the app.

### Mobile Application UI

Quick News with BERT is a proof of concept for how these automated summary models can be utilized in real life setting. The user will be able to choose news sites that are of their interest and see the latest updated articles and generate their summaries quickly and efficiently. 

Make sure you have Flutter installed on your local machine. For more instructions on how to install flutter, please take a look [here](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).

To test the app UI (available on both iOS and Android platforms), please run the following commands in your terminal, after installing Flutter:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/huydang90/Flutter-News-Summary-App.git
$ cd Flutter-News-Summary-App
$ flutter run
```
