# Unittest for News Summarization Project

The unittest files are to be run in the same folder as the code files to be test. Therefore, please change directory to the following order to access the tests: Code/src. 4 tests are available to check certain functionalities of the code files. 

```
$ cd Code/src                # change directory to src folder within the Code folder
$ python test_train.py
$ python test_post_stats.py
$ python test_utils.py
$ python test_cal_rouge.py        
```
